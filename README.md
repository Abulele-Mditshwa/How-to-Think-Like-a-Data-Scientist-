# How-to-Think-Like-a-Data-Scientist

This book is organized around the three phases of a data science project: 
# 1. The first phase is preparation—time and effort spent gathering information at the beginning of a project can spare big headaches later. 

# 2. The second phase is building the product, from planning through execution, using what you learned during the preparation phase and all the tools that statistics and software can provide.

# 3. The third and final phase is finishing—delivering the product, getting feedback, making revisions, supporting the product, and wrapping up the project.
